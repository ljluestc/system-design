System Design: Google Docs
In this response, I’ll guide you through designing a collaborative document editing service like Google Docs using a client-server architecture. We’ll establish the requirements, propose a detailed system design, address concurrency issues, and provide a file structure with 30 files totaling approximately 10,000 lines of code. While I won’t write the full 10,000 lines here due to space constraints, I’ll provide conceptual code snippets for each file, explain their purpose, and estimate how to expand them to reach the target line count.
What is Collaborative Document Editing?
Collaborative document editing allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously in real-time. Without such a service, collaboration becomes inefficient, as illustrated by the scenario of two students working on a project report. They exchange files, leading to version conflicts, duplicated efforts, and frustration. A service like Google Docs solves this by:
Enabling real-time editing and commenting.

Requiring only a browser, no specialized hardware.

Supporting remote access from any location.

Providing version history and restoration.

Offering free access to users.

Our goal is to design a system that replicates these benefits.
Design Approach
We’ll use a client-server architecture with microservices for scalability and maintainability. The design process is divided into four stages:
Requirements: Define functional and non-functional needs.

Design: Create a system architecture with key components.

Concurrency: Address conflict resolution in real-time editing.

Evaluation: Ensure the design is performant, consistent, available, and scalable.

Let’s proceed step-by-step.
Stage 1: Requirements for Google Docs’ Design
Functional Requirements
User Management: Register, login, and manage user profiles and permissions.

Document Management: Create, edit, delete, and store documents.

Real-Time Collaboration: Allow multiple users to edit a document simultaneously with updates visible instantly.

Version History: Track changes and enable reverting to previous versions.

Notifications: Alert users about mentions, shares, or updates.

Search: Enable searching within document content.

Comments: Allow users to add and view comments.

Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability: Handle millions of users and documents.

Performance: Low latency for real-time updates (<100ms).

Consistency: Ensure all users see a consistent document state.

Availability: Achieve 99.9% uptime.

Storage: Support terabytes of document data.

Infrastructure Estimates
Users: 10 million active users, with 1 million concurrent.

Documents: 100 million documents, averaging 100KB each (~10TB total).

Requests: 10,000 requests/second (CRUD operations).

Real-Time Updates: 100,000 updates/second via WebSockets.

Stage 2: Google Docs’ Design
High-Level Architecture
We’ll use a microservices architecture with the following components:
Client Application: Web-based interface for editing and collaboration.

API Gateway: Routes requests and handles authentication.

User Service: Manages users and permissions.

Document Service: Handles document metadata and storage.

Collaboration Service: Manages real-time editing and synchronization.

Versioning Service: Tracks document history.

Notification Service: Sends real-time alerts.

Search Service: Indexes and searches documents.

Technologies
WebSockets: For real-time communication.

Operational Transformation (OT): For conflict resolution (more in Stage 3).

Databases: PostgreSQL (user and metadata), MongoDB (document content and versions).

Caching: Redis for session and document state.

Message Queue: Kafka for asynchronous tasks.

Component Interactions
Client connects via WebSockets to the Collaboration Service and sends HTTP requests via the API Gateway.

API Gateway authenticates requests and routes them to services.

User Service verifies permissions.

Document Service stores metadata and content.

Collaboration Service applies edits and broadcasts updates.

Versioning Service logs changes.

Notification Service sends alerts.

Search Service updates indexes.

Stage 3: Concurrency in Collaborative Editing
Problem
When multiple users edit the same document simultaneously, conflicts arise (e.g., two users editing the same sentence). Without proper handling, edits could overwrite each other, leading to data loss.
Solution: Operational Transformation (OT)
OT transforms operations (insertions, deletions) based on concurrent edits to ensure consistency. For example:
User A inserts "Hello" at position 0.

User B deletes position 0 simultaneously.

OT adjusts User A’s operation to account for User B’s deletion.

The Collaboration Service uses an OT engine to:
Receive operations from clients.

Transform them against concurrent operations.

Apply the transformed operations to the document.

Broadcast updates to all clients.

Stage 4: Evaluating Google Docs’ Design
Performance: WebSockets and Redis caching ensure low latency.

Consistency: OT provides eventual consistency for edits.

Availability: Microservices with replication (e.g., via Docker) achieve high uptime.

Scalability: Horizontal scaling of services and databases supports growth.
