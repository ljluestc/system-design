System Design: The Typeahead Suggestion System
Below is a comprehensive system design for a Typeahead Suggestion System (also known as an autocomplete system), including a folder structure with 30 files and guidance on expanding it to over 10,000 lines of code. This design addresses the functional and non-functional requirements, focusing on scalability, reliability, real-time response handling, and personalization.
Introduction
The Typeahead Suggestion System provides real-time search query suggestions as users type, enhancing user experience in applications like search engines (e.g., Google), e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon), and text editors. It predicts and completes queries based on user history, context, and trending data, ensuring frequently searched terms rank higher. While it doesnâ€™t speed up search execution, it accelerates query formulation by offering relevant suggestions with low latency and high fault tolerance.
Requirements
Functional Requirements
User Interaction: Users type queries and receive real-time suggestions.

Real-Time Suggestions: Suggestions update dynamically as the user types.

Personalization: Incorporate user behavior and search history for tailored suggestions.

Scalability: Handle millions of concurrent users and queries.

Non-Functional Requirements
Low Latency: Deliver suggestions in <100ms.

High Availability: Ensure fault tolerance with no single point of failure.

Scalability: Support horizontal scaling for increased load.

Data Freshness: Reflect recent trends and user interactions in suggestions.

High-Level Design
The system comprises:
Frontend: A React-based UI for input and suggestion display.

Backend: A Node.js/Express server handling API requests and real-time updates via WebSocket.

Data Storage: Redis for in-memory caching and MongoDB for persistent storage.

Infrastructure: Docker, Nginx, and Kafka for containerization, load balancing, and message queuing.

AI Service: A lightweight AI model for personalized suggestions.
