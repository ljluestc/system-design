Stage 1: Requirements
Functional Requirements
Loan Application: Users apply for loans (e.g., $1,000–$10,000) via a mobile/web app, providing basic info (income, employment).

Credit Decisioning: Assess creditworthiness using alternative data (e.g., spending habits, social media activity) and traditional scores.

Virtual Credit Card: Issue a digital card for approved loans, usable for online/offline purchases (e.g., travel, dining).

Repayment Management: Offer flexible repayment (e.g., EMI, 45-day interest-free) with rewards (e.g., travel points).

Social Impact: Highlight ethical practices (e.g., donating profits to charity) to build trust.

User Dashboard: Display loan status, repayment schedule, and rewards.

Notifications: Send real-time alerts for payments, approvals, and promotions.

Analytics: Track user engagement, default rates, and loan performance.

Non-Functional Requirements
Latency: <1s for application submission and credit decision (99th percentile).

Scalability: Handle 1M users, 10K applications/day across distributed nodes.

Availability: 99.99% uptime, resilient to failures.

Consistency: Strong for loan records; eventual for analytics.

Security: Encrypt user data, comply with regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

User Experience: Frictionless UX, mobile-first, personalized for Millennials.

Optimization: High approval rates (>80%) for qualified Millennials, low default rates (<5%).

Resource Estimations
Assumptions:
1M users, 1% apply daily = 10K applications/day (~0.12 RPS).

Loan data: 1KB/application.

User sessions: 1MB/user.

Virtual card transactions: 100K/day, 100B/transaction.

Storage:
Applications: 10K × 1KB/day = 10MB/day.

Sessions: 1M × 1MB = 1TB.

Transactions: 100K × 100B = 10MB/day.

Total (daily): ~20MB (excluding sessions).

Bandwidth:
Upload: 10MB/day ÷ 86,400s × 8 = ~1Mbps.

Transactions: 10MB/day ÷ 86,400s × 8 = ~1Mbps.

Total: ~2Mbps.

Compute:
Applications: 0.12 RPS × 0.1s = ~12 servers (5K RPS/server).

Transactions: 100K ÷ 86,400 = ~1.2 TPS, minimal servers.

Total: ~20 servers.

Stage 2: System Design
Components
API Gateway: Routes user requests (apply, pay, view dashboard), enforces security (e.g., OAuth).

Onboarding Service: Handles loan applications, validates user data.

Credit Decisioning Service: Evaluates creditworthiness using rules and alternative data.

Card Service: Issues/manages virtual credit cards, processes transactions.

Repayment Service: Manages EMI schedules, rewards (e.g., travel points).

Notification Service: Sends alerts via email/SMS (mocked).

Data Stores:
User DB: Relational (mocked) for profiles, loans (strong consistency).

Transaction DB: NoSQL (mocked) for card usage (high write throughput).

Cache: Redis-like (mocked) for sessions, dashboards.

Message Queue: Kafka (mocked) for async tasks (notifications, analytics).

Monitoring: Prometheus (mocked) for latency, defaults, engagement.

Analytics Service: Tracks user behavior, loan performance.

Architecture

[Client/App] --> [API Gateway] --> [Onboarding Service]
                                   |
        --------------------------------------
        |                |                   |
 [Credit Decisioning]  [Card Service]  [Repayment Service]
        |                |                   |
      [User DB]       [Transaction DB]   [Notification Service]
         [Cache]                           [Message Queue]
                                             [Analytics Service]
                                             [Monitoring]

Workflow:
User submits loan application via app (api/server.py).

Onboarding Service validates data (onboarding/validator.py).

Credit Decisioning Service scores applicant (credit/decision.py).

Card Service issues virtual card if approved (card/issuer.py).

Repayment Service sets EMI, rewards (repayment/scheduler.py).

Notification Service sends approval alert (notification/service.py).

Analytics Service logs engagement (analytics/tracker.py).

Monitoring tracks performance (monitoring/metrics.py).

Millennial Optimization
Frictionless UX: One-tap application, minimal fields (inspired by web insights on simplicity).

Trust Markers: Display ethical policies, user reviews (emphasizing trust,).

Rewards: Travel points, lounge access for vacations (appealing to Millennials’ interests,).

Digital-First: Mobile app with Next.js frontend (mocked,).

Stage 3: In-Depth Investigation (Concurrency)
Concurrency Challenges
Application Overload: Multiple users applying simultaneously.

Credit Scoring Conflicts: Concurrent access to scoring data.

Transaction Spikes: High card usage during sales (e.g., Black Friday).

Notification Delays: Async alerts overwhelming queue.

Solutions
Application Overload:
Thread Pool: Use concurrent.futures in onboarding/validator.py for parallel validation.

Unlike Google Docs’ OT/CRDT, applications are independent, needing no complex sync.

Credit Scoring Conflicts:
Locking: Use threading.Lock in credit/decision.py for scoring data.

Similar to VM communication’s metadata DB, ensures consistency.

Transaction Spikes:
Sharding: Distribute transactions across nodes (routing/router.py).

Like CDN’s load balancing, scales throughput.

Notification Delays:
Backpressure: Limit queue in queue/kafka.py (mocked).

Akin to trigger word detection’s queue management.

Millennial-Specific Features
Alternative Data: Use spending patterns (mocked,) for credit scoring, appealing to Millennials with limited credit history.

Social Impact: Donate 1% of profits to charity, displayed in app (mocked in analytics/tracker.py,).

Rewards System: 10x points for travel/dining, redeemable for flights (mocked in repayment/rewards.py,).

Stage 4: Evaluation
Non-Functional Requirements
Latency:
Application: ~500ms (validation + scoring).

Transaction: ~100ms (cached).

Total: <1s, meeting requirement.

Scalability:
10K applications/day handled by 20 servers.

Sharding scales to 1M users.

Availability:
Redundant nodes ensure 99.99% uptime.

Monitoring detects failures.

Consistency:
Strong for loans (User DB).

Eventual for analytics (queue).

Security:
Encryption assumed (mocked).

OAuth in API Gateway (mocked).

User Experience:
Frictionless, mobile-first UX.

Trust via reviews, ethics ().

Optimization:
80% approval rate via alternative scoring.

<5% defaults via conservative rules.

Trade-offs
Latency vs. Accuracy: Fast scoring may miss edge cases; deeper analysis could slow decisions.

Cost vs. Scalability: More nodes reduce latency but raise costs.

Simplicity vs. Features: Minimal UI prioritizes ease but limits options (Millennials prefer simplicity,).
