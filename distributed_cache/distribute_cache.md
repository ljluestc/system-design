Stage 1: Requirements
Functional Requirements
Data Storage: Store frequently accessed key-value pairs in memory for fast retrieval.

Cache Operations: Support get, set, delete, and evict operations.

Cache Hit/Miss Handling: Return data from cache on hit; fetch from database and populate cache on miss.

Eviction Policy: Implement eviction (e.g., LRU, LFU) when cache is full.

Data Expiration: Support TTL (time-to-live) for automatic key expiration.

Distributed Coordination: Coordinate multiple cache nodes for data consistency and load balancing.

Session Management: Store user session data temporarily.

Monitoring Integration: Track cache metrics (hit/miss ratio, latency) and integrate with the client-side error monitoring system.

Fault Tolerance: Handle node failures without data loss.

Alerts: Notify operators (email, Slack) on critical issues (e.g., high miss rate, node failure).

Dashboard: Visualize cache performance (e.g., hit/miss ratio, node health).

Non-Functional Requirements
Latency: <1ms for cache get/set (99th percentile).

Scalability: Support 1M keys, 10M requests/day across 100 nodes.

Availability: 99.99% uptime, no single point of failure (SPOF).

Consistency: Eventual consistency for cache data; strong consistency for configuration.

Security: Encrypt data in transit/storage; authenticate access.

Resource Efficiency: <10% CPU overhead on cache nodes; <1MB/key.

Optimization: >90% cache hit rate; compact monitoring data.

Resource Estimations
Assumptions:
1M keys, 1MB/key, 10M requests/day (~116 RPS).

Cache hit rate: 90%, miss rate: 10% (1M requests/day to database).

Alerts: 1K/day, 1KB/alert.

Monitoring queries: 10K/day, 10KB/query.

Storage:
Cache: 1M keys × 1MB = 1TB total.

Monitoring data: 10GB/day (similar to client-side monitoring).

Configuration: 1MB (static).

Bandwidth:
Requests: 10M × 1MB ÷ 86,400s × 8 = ~9.3Gbps.

Monitoring: 10GB/day ÷ 86,400s × 8 = ~0.93Gbps.

Total: ~10.2Gbps.

Compute:
Requests: 116 RPS ÷ 5K RPS/node = ~1 node.

Monitoring/Alerts: ~4 nodes (from client-side monitoring).

Total: ~10 nodes (with buffer).

Stage 2: System Design
The distributed cache system uses a key-value store distributed across multiple nodes, with consistent hashing for data partitioning, LRU eviction, and integration with the client-side error monitoring system for performance tracking. It supports high availability through replication and fault tolerance via failover.
Components
Client SDK: Provides APIs for get, set, delete operations.

Cache Service: Manages cache nodes, handles requests, and coordinates data storage.

Storage Service: Stores key-value pairs in memory (e.g., RAM) and persists metadata to disk.

Eviction Service: Implements LRU eviction policy.

Replication Service: Replicates data across nodes for fault tolerance.

Consistent Hashing Service: Partitions data across nodes using a hash ring.

Configuration Service: Manages cache settings (e.g., TTL, node list).

Monitoring Service: Tracks cache metrics (hit/miss ratio, latency) and integrates with client-side error monitoring.

Alert Service: Sends notifications for issues (e.g., node failure).

Dashboard Service: Visualizes cache performance.

API Gateway: Routes client requests; enforces authentication.

Data Stores
In-Memory Store: Stores key-value pairs (e.g., Redis-like).

Metadata Store: Persists node metadata (e.g., PostgreSQL).

Monitoring TSDB: Stores performance metrics (e.g., InfluxDB).

Cache: Caches hot configuration data (e.g., Redis).

Message Queue: Handles async tasks (e.g., Kafka).

Stage 3: In-Depth Investigation (Concurrency and Features)
Concurrency Challenges
Request Overload: High request volumes (10M/day) overwhelming nodes.

Write Conflicts: Concurrent writes to the same key.

Replication Lag: Delayed data sync across nodes.

Monitoring Overhead: High metric collection impacting performance.

Solutions
Request Overload:
Thread pool in cache/service.py for parallel request handling.

Cap at 5K requests/sec/node.

Write Conflicts:
Locking in storage/memory.py for serialized writes.

Batch writes every 10ms.

Replication Lag:
Async replication in replication/sync.py with eventual consistency.

Sync every 100ms.

Monitoring Overhead:
Sample metrics in monitoring/metrics.py (1% of requests).

Cache hot metrics in storage/cache.py.

Cache-Specific Features
Consistent Hashing: Distributes keys evenly (hashing/consistent.py).

LRU Eviction: Removes least recently used keys (eviction/lru.py).

Replication: Ensures fault tolerance (replication/service.py).

Monitoring Integration: Tracks hit/miss ratio, integrates with client-side monitoring (monitoring/integrator.py).

Visualization: Graphs cache performance (e.g., hit rate) (dashboard/visualizer.py).

Stage 4: Evaluation
Non-Functional Requirements
Latency: <1ms for get/set (in-memory access).

Scalability: 10M requests/day with 10 nodes; scales to 1M keys.

Availability: 99.99% uptime via replication and failover.

Consistency: Eventual for cache data, strong for configuration.

Security: TLS encryption, OAuth (api_gateway/auth.py).

Resource Efficiency: <10% CPU, <1MB/key.

Optimization: >90% hit rate; compact monitoring data.

Trade-offs
Consistency vs. Latency: Eventual consistency reduces latency but risks stale reads.

Storage vs. Cost: In-memory storage is fast but expensive (1TB RAM).

Monitoring vs. Performance: Detailed metrics increase overhead but improve insights.
