High-Level Design of Uber
Components
User App: Interface for riders to request rides and for drivers to accept them.

Driver App: Manages driver availability and ride assignments.

Backend Services:
User Service: Handles user accounts and authentication.

Ride Service: Manages ride requests, matching, and status updates.

Location Service: Tracks real-time locations of drivers and riders.

Payment Service: Processes payments (simplified in this example).

Notification Service: Sends updates (omitted here for simplicity).

Database: Stores user data, ride history, and driver info (simulated with dictionaries here).

Matching Algorithm: Matches riders with the nearest available drivers (simplified in this example).

Real-Time Communication: Typically uses WebSockets, but simulated here with direct calls.

Architecture
Microservices: Each service operates independently for scalability.

API Gateway: Routes requests from apps to services (not implemented here but implied).

Message Queue: Handles asynchronous tasks (simulated synchronously here).

Database: A mix of SQL (structured data) and NoSQL (location data), simulated with in-memory storage.

Workflow
Ride Request: Rider submits a pickup and drop-off location.

Driver Matching: System finds the nearest available driver.

Ride Acceptance: Driver accepts, and rider is notified.

Real-Time Tracking: Locations are tracked (simulated here).

Ride Completion: Ride ends, and payment is processed.
