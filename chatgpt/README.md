System Design Overview
Functional Requirements
User Interaction: Users can send messages and receive conversational responses via a web interface.

Real-Time Response Handling: Responses are delivered quickly using WebSockets for real-time updates.

Scalability: The system supports multiple concurrent users with horizontal scaling via load balancing and queues.

Reliability: Ensures uptime with robust error handling, logging, and monitoring.

Architecture
Frontend: A React-based web interface for user interaction.

Backend: A Node.js/Express server managing API requests, WebSockets, and queues.

AI Service: A separate service (mocked here for simplicity) to generate responses.

Database: MongoDB for storing users and conversation history.

Infrastructure: Docker, Nginx, and Redis for scalability and reliability.

File Structure
The system is modularized into 30 files, grouped by functionality:
Frontend (10 files): Handles the user interface and client-side logic.

Backend (12 files): Manages server-side logic, API routes, and real-time communication.

AI Service (3 files): Provides response generation (mocked for this example).

Infrastructure (3 files): Configures deployment and scaling.

Testing and Docs (2 files): Includes unit tests and documentation.
