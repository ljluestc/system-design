Stage 1: Requirements
Functional Requirements
User Interaction: Support text-based user queries via a web interface or API, handling natural language input.

Real-Time Response: Generate human-like responses within 2 seconds (99th percentile).

Context Retention: Maintain conversation context for multi-turn dialogues (e.g., up to 10 turns).

Model Inference: Use a large language model (LLM) for response generation, supporting diverse queries.

User Authentication: Secure user access with OAuth-based authentication.

Message Queuing: Handle asynchronous tasks (e.g., logging, analytics) via a distributed messaging queue.

Monitoring Integration: Track system metrics (e.g., latency, error rates) and integrate with client-side error monitoring.

Alerts: Notify operators (email, Slack) for critical issues (e.g., model failures, high latency).

Dashboard: Visualize system performance (e.g., response times, user load).

Content Moderation: Filter inappropriate content in queries and responses.

Non-Functional Requirements
Latency: <2s for response generation (99th percentile).

Scalability: Support 10M daily active users, 100M queries/day across 100 nodes.

Availability: 99.99% uptime, no single point of failure (SPOF).

Reliability: <0.1% error rate for response generation.

Consistency: Eventual consistency for conversation history; strong consistency for user authentication.

Security: Encrypt data in transit/storage; comply with GDPR.

Resource Efficiency: <10% CPU overhead per node; <1KB/query for metadata.

Optimization: >95% query success rate; compact monitoring data.

Resource Estimations
Assumptions:
10M users, 10 queries/user/day, 1KB/query (input + response).

Total: 100M queries/day (~1,157 RPS).

Alerts: 1K/day, 1KB/alert.

Monitoring queries: 10K/day, 10KB/query.

Model inference: 1 GPU (e.g., NVIDIA A100) per 100 queries/sec.

Storage:
Queries: 100M × 1KB = 100GB/day.

Conversation history: 10M users × 10KB/history = 100GB (static, 30-day retention).

Monitoring: 10GB/day.

Total: ~210GB/day.

Bandwidth:
Queries: 100GB/day ÷ 86,400s × 8 = ~9.3Gbps.

Monitoring: 10GB/day ÷ 86,400s × 8 = ~0.93Gbps.

Total: ~10.2Gbps.

Compute:
Queries: 1,157 RPS ÷ 100 RPS/GPU = ~12 GPUs.

Supporting services: ~20 nodes (front-end, messaging, monitoring).

Total: ~30 nodes (with buffer).

Stage 2: System Design
The ChatGPT-like system uses a microservices architecture with a distributed messaging queue for asynchronous tasks, consistent hashing for load balancing, and a large language model (LLM) for inference. It ensures scalability via sharding, reliability through replication, and real-time performance with in-memory caching.
Components
Client Interface: Web UI (React) and REST API for user queries.

API Gateway: Routes requests, enforces OAuth, and rate-limits.

Front-End Service: Validates queries, manages sessions, and dispatches to inference service.

Inference Service: Runs LLM (e.g., transformer-based model) on GPUs for response generation.

Context Service: Maintains conversation history for multi-turn dialogues.

Moderation Service: Filters inappropriate content using rule-based and ML models.

Messaging Queue Service: Handles async tasks (e.g., logging, analytics) using Kafka.

Monitoring Service: Tracks metrics and integrates with client-side error monitoring.

Alert Service: Sends notifications for issues (e.g., high latency).

Dashboard Service: Visualizes performance metrics.

Data Stores
In-Memory Cache: Stores session data and hot conversation history (Redis).

Conversation Store: Persists conversation history (DynamoDB).

Model Store: Stores LLM weights (S3).

Monitoring TSDB: Stores metrics (InfluxDB).

Message Queue: Kafka for async tasks.

Workflow:
User Query: Client submits query via UI/API (client/interface.py).

Routing: API Gateway authenticates and routes to Front-End Service (api_gateway/router.py).

Validation: Front-End Service validates input and checks moderation (frontend/service.py, moderation/service.py).

Context Retrieval: Context Service fetches conversation history (context/service.py).

Inference: Inference Service runs LLM to generate response (inference/service.py).

Response: Response sent back to user; metadata logged to Kafka (messaging/queue.py).

Monitoring: Metrics tracked and visualized (monitoring/metrics.py, dashboard/visualizer.py).

Alerting: Issues trigger notifications (alert/service.py).

Fixes for AWS Outage Resilience

Inference Bottlenecks:
Batch inference in inference/service.py to optimize GPU usage.

Auto-scale GPU nodes (inference/optimizer.py).

Context Conflicts:
Eventual consistency with DynamoDB (context/store.py).

Lock-free updates using optimistic concurrency (context/service.py).

Queue Congestion:
Partition Kafka topics (messaging/queue.py).

Rate-limit producers (messaging/producer.py).

System-Specific Features

Non-Functional Requirements
Latency: <2s for 99th percentile queries (GPU optimization).

Scalability: 100M queries/day with 30 nodes; scales via sharding.

Availability: 99.99% uptime with multi-region failover.

Reliability: <0.1% error rate via moderation and retry logic.

Consistency: Eventual for history, strong for authentication.

Security: TLS encryption, OAuth, GDPR-compliant (api_gateway/auth.py).

Resource Efficiency: <10% CPU, <1KB/query metadata.

Optimization: >95% query success; compact metrics.

Trade-offs
Latency vs. Accuracy: Faster inference may reduce response quality; mitigated by model optimization.

Cost vs. Scalability: More GPUs/nodes increase costs; balanced with auto-scaling.

Complexity vs. Reliability: Microservices add complexity; mitigated with monitoring and failover.
