Non-Functional Requirements
Latency: <1s for metric collection, <5s for alerts (99th percentile).

Scalability: Support 1M servers, 1B metrics/day across 100 nodes.

Availability: 99.99% uptime, no single point of failure (SPOF).

Consistency: Eventual consistency for metrics; strong consistency for alerts and rules.

Security: Encrypt metric data in transit/storage; authenticate access with OAuth.

Resource Efficiency: Minimal overhead on monitored servers (<1% CPU).

Optimization: >95% alert accuracy; compact visualization (e.g., heat maps for 1M servers).

Resource Estimations
Assumptions:
1M servers, each generating 1,000 metrics/day (e.g., CPU, memory), 1KB/metric.

Total: 1B metrics/day (~11,574 RPS).

Alerts: 1K alerts/day, 1KB/alert.

Dashboard queries: 10K queries/day, 10KB/query.

Storage:
Metrics: 1B × 1KB = 1TB/day.

Alerts: 1K × 1KB = 1MB/day.

Rules: 10K rules × 1KB = 10MB (static).

Total (daily): ~1TB (metrics dominate).

Bandwidth:
Metrics: 1TB/day ÷ 86,400s × 8 bits = ~92Gbps.

Queries: 10K × 10KB ÷ 86,400s × 8 = ~0.01Mbps.

Total: ~92Gbps.

Compute:
Metrics: 11,574 RPS ÷ 5K RPS/server = ~24 servers.

Alerts: 1K ÷ 86,400s = ~0.01 RPS (negligible).

Total: ~30 servers (with buffer).

Stage 2: System Design
The monitoring system uses a hybrid push/pull architecture to balance scalability and network efficiency, with failover mechanisms to eliminate SPOF and retention policies for storage optimization.
Components
API Gateway: Routes client requests (queries, rule updates, dashboards); enforces OAuth authentication.

Collector Service: Pulls metrics (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) from servers within a data center using a discovery service.

Pusher Service: Receives aggregated metrics pushed from secondary monitoring nodes to primary/global nodes.

Storage Service: Manages time-series database (TSDB) for metrics and blob storage for archived data (e.g., 100,000 files).

Rules Service: Stores and evaluates alert rules (e.g., “if CPU > 90%, trigger alert”).

Alert Manager: Sends notifications (email, Slack) on rule violations.

Query Service: Handles metric queries for dashboards and analytics.

Dashboard Service: Generates visualizations (heat maps, graphs) for system health.

Discovery Service: Dynamically identifies servers/services to monitor (e.g., integrates with Consul, Kubernetes).

Data Stores

Workflow
Discovery: Discovery Service identifies servers/services dynamically (e.g., via Consul) (discovery/registry.py).

Metric Collection: Collector Service pulls metrics from servers within a data center (collector/puller.py).

Metric Aggregation: Secondary nodes push aggregated metrics to Pusher Service at primary/global nodes (pusher/receiver.py).

Storage: Storage Service saves metrics to TSDB, archives older data to blob storage (storage/tsdb.py, storage/blob.py).

Rule Evaluation: Rules Service evaluates metrics against thresholds (rules/evaluator.py).

Alerting: Alert Manager sends notifications for violations (alert/manager.py).

Querying: Query Service fetches metrics for analytics (query/service.py).

Visualization: Dashboard Service renders heat maps and graphs (dashboard/heatmap.py).

Self-Monitoring: Monitoring tracks system performance (e.g., latency, errors) (monitoring/metrics.py).

Fixes for Cons
SPOF: Deploy failover nodes for monitoring services with TSDB replication (storage/tsdb.py). Use leader-election (e.g., ZooKeeper) for consistency.

Scalability: Hybrid push/pull strategy—pull within data centers, push to primary/global nodes (collector/puller.py, pusher/receiver.py). Scale collectors/storage horizontally.

Data Retention: Implement a retention policy to delete metrics >30 days (storage/retention.py), archiving to blob storage for long-term needs.

Stage 3: In-Depth Investigation (Concurrency and Monitoring Features)
Concurrency Challenges
Metric Collection Overload: Simultaneous pulls from 1M servers risk overwhelming collectors or servers.

Push Conflicts: Concurrent pushes from secondary nodes to primary nodes may cause data inconsistencies.

Alert Storms: High alert volumes (e.g., during outages) may overload the Alert Manager.

Query Bottlenecks: Concurrent dashboard queries may slow TSDB performance.

Solutions
Metric Collection Overload:
Thread Pool: Use concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor in collector/puller.py to parallelize pulls with rate-limiting.

Comparison: Unlike collaborative editing (e.g., Google Docs’ OT/CRDT), metrics are independent, requiring no complex synchronization.

Implementation: Cap concurrent pulls per collector to 100 servers to ensure <1% CPU overhead.

Push Conflicts:
Locking: Use threading.Lock in pusher/receiver.py to serialize metric ingestion at primary nodes.

Comparison: Similar to transaction locks in financial systems, ensuring consistent metric updates.

Implementation: Batch pushes every 10s to reduce lock contention.

Alert Storms:
Rate Limiting: Cap alerts at 10/sec in alert/manager.py using a message queue (Kafka).

Comparison: Like notification backpressure in messaging systems, prevents downstream overload.

Implementation: Deduplicate similar alerts within a 1-minute window to achieve >95% accuracy.

Query Bottlenecks:
Caching: Cache hot metrics (e.g., recent CPU usage) in storage/cache.py (Redis-like).

Comparison: Similar to CDN caching for low-latency reads.

Implementation: Cache 1 hour of metrics (~10GB for 1M servers), reducing TSDB load by 80%.

Monitoring-Specific Features
Hybrid Push/Pull:
Pull metrics within data centers for simplicity (collector/puller.py).

Push aggregated data from secondary to primary/global nodes for scalability (pusher/receiver.py).

Example: 1 secondary node monitors 5,000 servers, pushing to 1 primary node per data center.

Heat Maps:
Visualize 1M servers’ health compactly (125KB, 1 bit/server: 1=live, 0=dead) (dashboard/heatmap.py).

Color-code racks by data center/cluster/row for quick issue localization (e.g., red for offline).

Retention Policy:
Delete metrics >30 days from TSDB, archive to blob storage (storage/retention.py).

Example: Keep 1TB/day for 30 days (30TB), archive older data to S3 for 1 year.

Failover:
Replicate TSDB across nodes with eventual consistency (storage/tsdb.py).

Use leader-election to switch to failover nodes during failures.

Stage 4: Evaluation
Non-Functional Requirements
Latency:
Collection: ~500ms (optimized pulls with thread pools).

Alerts: ~2s (rule evaluation + notification via Kafka).

Queries: ~500ms (cached metrics).

Result: Meets <1s collection, <5s alert requirements (99th percentile).

Scalability:
Handles 1B metrics/day (~11,574 RPS) with ~30 servers.

Hierarchical push/pull scales to 1M servers (1 secondary node per 5,000 servers).

Blob storage supports 100,000 files with partitioning/compression.

Availability:
Failover nodes and TSDB replication ensure 99.99% uptime.

Self-monitoring detects failures within 10s (monitoring/metrics.py).

Consistency:
Strong consistency for rules (Rules DB, transactional updates).

Eventual consistency for metrics (TSDB, replication lag <1s).

Security:
Encrypt metrics in transit/storage (TLS, AES-256, mocked).

OAuth for API access (api_gateway/auth.py).

GDPR compliance for data retention (mocked).

Resource Efficiency:
<1% CPU overhead on monitored servers via rate-limited pulls.

Blob storage offloads TSDB, reducing costs.

Optimization:
95% alert accuracy with deduplication and precise rules.

Heat maps visualize 1M servers compactly (125KB).

Trade-offs
Latency vs. Accuracy:
Fast pulls (500ms) may miss transient spikes; slower pulls could improve accuracy but increase latency.

Choice: Prioritize low latency for real-time monitoring, use anomaly detection for spikes.

Cost vs. Scalability:
More nodes reduce latency but increase costs (~30 servers, $10K/month estimate).

Choice: Optimize with caching and retention to minimize nodes.

Retention vs. Storage:
Deleting metrics >30 days saves space (30TB vs. 365TB/year) but risks losing historical data.

Choice: Archive to blob storage for long-term analysis at lower cost.

Comparison to Previous Design
The refined design improves on the previous version by:
Structuring in Stages: Aligns with the provided document’s four-stage format for clarity.

Addressing Concurrency: Adds thread pools, locking, and rate-limiting for robust metric collection and alerting.

Enhancing Scalability: Explicitly defines hierarchical push/pull ratios (1:5,000 servers) and blob storage for 100,000 files.

Improving Visualization: Emphasizes heat maps for compact, actionable insights (125KB for 1M servers).

Mitigating Cons: Adds failover replication, retention policies, and caching to address SPOF, storage bloat, and query bottlenecks.

Handling “100,000 Files” and Large-Scale Data
Storage: Store 100,000 files in blob storage (e.g., S3) with partitioning by date/service and compression (e.g., gzip, reducing 1TB to ~200GB).

Metadata: Index file metadata (name, timestamp, size) in a NoSQL database (e.g., DynamoDB) or Elasticsearch for fast queries.

Retention: Archive files >30 days to cold storage (e.g., S3 Glacier), delete after 1 year (storage/retention.py).

Access: Query Service retrieves files via APIs (query/service.py), caching frequent accesses in storage/cache.py.

Total: ~0.93Gbps.

Compute:
Reports: 116 RPS ÷ 5K RPS/server = ~1 server.

Total: ~5 servers (with buffer).
